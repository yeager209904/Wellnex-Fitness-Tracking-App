## 🧪 The Science Behind Wellnex

Our strength prediction leverages advanced machine learning:

```
Prediction Model: Random Forest Regressor
Training Data: OpenPowerlifting Database
Optimization: Grid Search Hyperparameter Tuning
```

The model analyzes patterns from thousands of lifters to predict your potential strength gains based on:
- Your lifting history and progression
- Training frequency and volume
- Personal factors and performance metrics

As you continue logging workouts, the model receives more data points, refining its predictions for even greater accuracy.
